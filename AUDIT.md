# Security Audit Report - WALLETDB Encryption Implementation

## Overview

This audit report documents the security of Raze Bot application. The encryption was implemented to protect sensitive wallet private keys stored locally.

### Key Findings
- **Encryption Standard:** AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) via crypto-js library
- **Storage Security:** Private keys are encrypted at rest in both localStorage and IndexedDB
- **Error Handling:** Robust fallback mechanisms prevent data loss

## Technical Implementation Review

### 1. Encryption Algorithm
- **Algorithm:** AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- **Library:** crypto-js v4.2.0
- **Key Management:** Static encryption key (see recommendations)

### 2. Storage Architecture
```
Wallet Data Flow:
Plaintext Wallet Data → AES Encryption → Encrypted Storage (localStorage + IndexedDB)
```

### 3. Key Functions Audited

#### `encryptData(data: string): string`
- ✅ Properly encrypts data using AES
- ✅ Includes error handling
- ✅ Returns encrypted string

#### `decryptData(encryptedData: string): string`
- ✅ Properly decrypts AES encrypted data
- ✅ Validates decryption success
- ✅ Throws errors for invalid data

#### `saveWalletsToCookies(wallets: WalletType[]): void`
- ✅ Encrypts wallet data before storage
- ✅ Stores in both localStorage and IndexedDB
- ✅ Removes old unencrypted data
- ✅ Includes fallback mechanisms

#### `loadWalletsFromCookies(): WalletType[]`
- ✅ Attempts to load encrypted data first
- ✅ Automatic migration from unencrypted data
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Logging for debugging

## Security Strengths

### ✅ Encryption Implementation
- Uses industry-standard AES encryption
- Proper error handling prevents data corruption
- Encrypted data stored in multiple locations for redundancy

### ✅ Storage Security
- Private keys never stored in plaintext after implementation
- Dual storage (localStorage + IndexedDB) for reliability
- Proper key-value structure in IndexedDB

### ✅ Error Resilience
- Multiple fallback mechanisms
- Graceful degradation if encryption fails
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
